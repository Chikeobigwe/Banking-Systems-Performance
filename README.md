# Banking System Performance Analysis in Power BI

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **performance of banking systems**, focusing on transaction speed, failure rates, and system efficiency. Using **Power BI**, **DAX**, and data from **JMeter performance testing**, the analysis identifies critical issues affecting banking transactions and provides insights to optimize system performance.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes **20 tables** from JMeter performance testing, each corresponding to different banking transactions, such as:

- **Login**
- **Airtime Purchase**
- **Customer Loan Information**
- **Fund Transfers**
- **Bill Payments**

Each table contains key performance metrics:

- **Transactions Per Second (TPS)** – Measures system throughput.
- **Average Response Time (ms)** – The mean time taken for a transaction to be completed.
- **Min/Max Response Time** – The shortest and longest recorded transaction times.
- **Standard Deviation** – Indicates the consistency of transaction response times.
- **Error Percentage** – The failure rate of transactions.
- **Received & Sent KB/sec** – Measures system load and network performance.
- **Average Bytes** – The average data size per transaction.

## Key Analyses & Insights

### **1. Transaction Speed Analysis**

- Which **transactions have the highest and lowest average response times**?
- How does **transaction speed vary under different loads**?
- What transactions show **high standard deviation**, indicating inconsistent performance?

### **2. Failure Rate & Error Analysis**

- Which banking operations have the **highest failure rates**?
- What are the **patterns in error percentages** across different transaction types?
- Are there **specific time periods or load conditions where failure rates spike**?

### **3. System Load & Performance**

- How do **transactions per second (TPS) vary across different banking functions**?
- What is the correlation between **high TPS and response time fluctuations**?
- How does **data transfer (KB/sec) impact system performance**?

### **4. Performance Under Load Conditions**

- Which transactions slow down significantly under heavy usage?
- Are there specific **transaction types that degrade under peak loads**?
- What optimizations can be made to improve **banking system efficiency**?

## Tools Used

- **Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing and visualization

## Project Outcomes

- **Identified key bottlenecks in banking transactions**.
- Provided insights on **slow, high-error, and inconsistent transactions**.
- Offered **recommendations for optimizing banking system performance**.

## How to Explore the Dashboard

- Use **filters** to analyze performance across different transaction types.
- Compare **response times, failure rates, and TPS** to identify inefficiencies.
- Explore trends in **system load and data transfer metrics** to optimize resources.
